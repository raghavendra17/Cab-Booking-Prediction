# Cab-Booking-Prediction
Python Machine Learning project using scikitlearn,pandas,numpy,matplotlib

# Problem Statement
Build a Machine Learning model to predict the total count of cabs booked in each hour by the new data

Cab booking system is the process where renting a cab is automated through an app throughout a city.Using this app people can book a cab from one location to another location.  
Being a cab booking app company, exploiting an understanding of cab supply and demand could increase the efficiency of their service and enhance user experience by minimizing waiting time.

## Objective of this project 
To combine historical usage pattern along with the open data sources like weather data to forecast cab booking demand in a city.

## Process Flow
You will be provided with hourly renting data span of two years. 
Data is randomly divided into train and test set. You must predict the total count of cabs booked in each hour covered by the testset
